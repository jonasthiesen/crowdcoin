# CrowdCoin: Kickstarter clone on the Ethereum Blockchain

This project was developed with the help of the Udemy course *Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide* by Stephen Grider. This has helped me understand a lot about how the Ethereum Blockchain works on a technological level, and not just in the abstract.

**Disclaimer**: this code should never go into production. None of the contracts have been tested for security flaws so they are probably rather unsafe to use.
